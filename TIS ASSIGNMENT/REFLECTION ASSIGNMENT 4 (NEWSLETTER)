I think by visiting the Huawei Company and also Exxon Mobile by Petronas in Kuala Lumpur , I can develop more interest in Technology. 
It is because I found it is very interesting to gain a lot of knowledge from the talk by employers in Exxon Mobile and
I have a lot of fun . It also inspire me on how to get a better job with convenient workplace because I think Exxon Mobile has very cozy 
workplace that i really like. The skills that discovered were analytical thinking and prblem solving, programming skills, productivity skills
, software development process (SDLC) and also life-long learning. Other than that, by visiting Huawei exhibition , 
I discover a lot of good technology that big organization would use and I think it is very impressive to have 
qNa session with the worker there.
