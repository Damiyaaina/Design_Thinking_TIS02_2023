What I learn from this whole program are the degree that we have one day should empower us to get a better job.
Other than that, we also need to start everything as early as possible because we don’t
know what happen in future but the best thing always comes first. I also think that we should
make some time to participate in a lot of activities because by joining these activities ,
it can build our teamwork , communication skills , brave and also gain knowledge from those activities. Our social networking also 
can be expanded because we always meet new people and that can train us how
to handle with people’s personality and fit in society. I also enjoyed qNa session with the invited host.
