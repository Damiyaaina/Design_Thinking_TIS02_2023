I think as a computer science student, I got to learn not only the software part and the technology but also got the opportunity
to learn about the hardware part of the computer and its component which is the PC itself. I got to learn how to assemble
and diassemble the part of the PC. I also got to know all the important thing in PC such as the cable, the motherboard,
the power supply, RAM and ROM and also the Hard Disk. It is a very interesting process.
