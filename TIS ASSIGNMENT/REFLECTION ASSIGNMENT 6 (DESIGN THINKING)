I think this project was the longest in this semester because we need to complete 4 task in one big project.
the first one was we need to do a slid presentation and what i learned from this task is I think by doing a simple presentation
, it can ease the audience and I learn how to manage my time. Other than that, I got to polish my communication skills by this project
because I got to interviewed one of the UTM digital staff and also I need to present in front of my classmate so it helped me a lot. 
Besides, I also think that by doing a video for this project , I can improve my designing and editing skills because I have a lot of passion 
in designing something. I also learned how to make a prototype based on my group project so it is very enjoyable process.
