What I learn from this whole program are the degree that we have one day should empower us to get a better job. Other than that, we also need to
start everything as early as possible because we don’t know what happen in future but the best thing always comes first. I also think that we should
make some time to participate in a lot of activities because by joining these activities , it can build our teamwork , communication skills , brave and also
gain knowledge from those activities. Our social networking also can be expanded because we always meet new people and that can train us how
to handle with people’s personality and fit in society. I also think by visiting the Huawei Company and also Exxon Mobile by Petronas in Kuala Lumpur , i can develop more interest in Technology. it is because I found it is very interesting to gain a lot 
of knowledge from the talk by employers in Exxon Mobile and I have a lot of fun . It also inspire me on how to get a better job with convenient workplace because I think Exxon Mobile has very cozy 
workplace that i really like. Other than that, by visiting Huawei exhibition , I discover a lot of good technology that big organization would use and I think it is very impressive to have 
qNa session with the worker there.
