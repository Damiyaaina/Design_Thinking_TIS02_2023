I think I will concentrate on the talents that lecturer has often emphasizes such as programming , 
software development and communication skills given the importance of these in today's employment market.
It is also important because i think it will develop more benefits either for the technology itself or for ourselves. 
apart from that, i also think that life long learning will help me on surviving in the work industry as technology will 
always change from time to time.
